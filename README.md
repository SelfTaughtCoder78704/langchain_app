* The main.py file is a flask server that has an index route. It also has a /chat endpoint. This fetches products from an exteranl link, then sends them along with
instructions to the AI to only speak about them from now on.
* The folder with the generator and the agent are 2 different apps. 
  * The agent can perform searches and math. 
  * The generator can read a text file, create components, create a svelte app, copy the components into the src dir of the svelte app and then run the app.
